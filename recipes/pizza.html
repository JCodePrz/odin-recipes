<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Pizza Dough Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (105째F-115째F)</li>
    <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
    <li>3 3/4 cups bread flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pizza Ingredients & topping</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>Tomato sauce (smooth or pureed)</li>
    <li>Firm mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
    <li>Italian pepperoncini, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>Pepperoni, thinly sliced</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes
        After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.
    </li>
    <li>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil,Knead the pizza dough. The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.
        At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. Cover the dough with plastic wrap.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Preparing the pizza</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place a pizza pan into the stove and Preheat the oven to 475째F for at least 30 minutes to an hour
    </li>
    <li>Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit.</li>
    <li>Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).</li>
    <li>Prepare your desired toppings.</li>
    <li>Working with the dough, take the dough and flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface.
        Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further.
    </li>
    <li>Brush the top of the dough with olive oil (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings). Let rest another 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza</li>
    <li>Bake pizza in the 475째F oven until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10-15 minutes. </li>
